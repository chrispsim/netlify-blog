# Background
Just like most college students, I only had access to a limited amount of money. Therefore, the micromanagement of my finances was crucial to me of being financially responsible and would prevent me from squandering every penny I have. Recently, while sorting through my expenditures and calculating the savings I made at the end of every month, I found a recurring pattern that piqued my interest. The trend that I noticed is that the total amount of money I was spending on groceries each month seemed to exceed the designated budget. Despite increasing the base budget for groceries, I was still overspending. I soon realized that there were multiple reasons overspending occurs. Partly it was due to my diet for international dishes. Many times international dishes require unique ingredients that could only be sourced from global food markets and are expensive since the ingredients are rather exotic.

Furthermore, despite planning what dishes to cook each day for every month, there are bound to be meals that are overlooked and not accounted for. These anomalies are the root cause of my overspending habits. Soon I found out that the problem of overspending was not only limited to me, but many of my fellow peers at school also experienced the same problem, and many had their qualms in regards to the root causes of their overspending. Hence, when the opportunity arose during my user-centered design class in the Winter quarter of 2018,  I proposed the proposition of designing a viable intervention to solve the grocery budgeting problem that stems from positively impacting students at the University of Washington (UW).

# Problem Statement
Overspending on the grocery budget is a prevalent nagging problem that is currently plaguing many aspects of society and is yet to be solved. The hypothesis is that an intervention that genuinely addresses the issue would be a massive success based on the assumption that many shoppers would like to save money. The intervention should aim to be an all-in-one solution because as much as the goal is to save money, it is also for the sake of convenience, and the intention to integrate thought cohesiveness as well as structured organization into the subconscious of our users.

# Research
There are two goals that the team aims to accomplish while conducting our research. One of our focuses is to gather data on our potential/target users. It is crucial to validate that the problem we are trying to solve does not only adhere to one community but many. Furthermore, not only are we using the data collected as a path to validation, but it is also incredibly important to understand the people we are trying to design an intervention for. User research data provided our team with valuable insights in regards to accessibility, constraints, and localization requirements.

The team‚Äôs secondary research focuses on market/competition analysis. In order to design our minimal viable product (MVP), it is vital to understand market trends, the current solutions that are trying to address the problem, and the product landscape.

## Research Methods
To conduct our user research, we utilized a myriad of UX research methods. We conducted an on-site survey with UW students using Kahoot, the game-based learning platform, to make the experience much more engaging with our participants. We conducted a focus group a week later with the same participants of the on-site survey to gain more insights on more specific topics that align and was built on the previous survey questions. Additionally, our team designed an online survey using Survey Monkey as well and deployed it on our social media in order to gain a broader audience.

After gathering all the data, our team added the data into Google Sheets and analyzed the metrics during our scheduled team meeting.

## Research Findings
To provide some insights in regards to our research demographics. We conducted our research with a total of 40 participants, 28 are full-time students at the UW (19 were STEM majors, 3 majored in business, and the rest are liberal arts students), 12 non-UW students (4 are from neighboring schools in the Greater Seattle Area, 4 stay-at-home parents, 4 adults working full-time).

After dissecting the data collected, the team found some interesting anomalies. It was almost a consensus from all our participants that they experience a form of overspending in their grocery budget. However, what struck us as interesting was when approached about the current solutions they are practicing to prevent overspending, almost no one from our group of participants said they are currently implementing a solution. Despite the median overspending budget was practically a 15% margin of the overall budget, many of our participants responded that they do not mind the overspending. Some of our participants either found existing solutions too clunky to use or the learning curve is just too steep to justify spending the time, and this is particularly true for college students. Another intriguing find was that many participants would give solutions to address grocery budgeting more thought if only they were incentivized on top of saving money.

In regards to our market/competitor research, as reported by Forbes in 2018, the global food tech industry is expected to reach $250 Billion by 2022. The food tech industry is still at its infancy and is ripe for disruption. There is a myriad of startups currently attempting to tackle the grocery market. However, none of them are seemed to be targeted at our target demographic. In the table attached below lists the features of these services:

| Company       |Service/Features| Pricing  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Blue Apron      | Recipe meal-kit service, each kit contains ingredients and exotic recipes with clear instructions, recipes are switched out weekly, vegan options.| $47.95 - $119.84 (Weekly)|
| Freshly    | Meal-kit service with a twist, a professional chef prepares the food before delivery, the user only needs to reheat the food. | $49.99 - $107.99 (Weekly)|
| Hello Fresh | Similar to Blue Apron, ingredients sourced from local organic markets, only 8 recipes to choose from weekly, recipes are created by acclaimed chefs.|    $69.99 - $129.99 (Weekly)|
| Plated |Similar to Blue Apron and Hello Fresh, all ingredients are organic. | $47.80 - $159.20 (Weekly) |

As listed in the table above, many of these food tech companies are selling the idea that by providing the convenience of saving time, having the groceries and recipes sent to your doorstep, hence it outweighs the financial cost to these services.

While the team was still breaking down the collected data and was at the starting point of ideating the solution as well as an incentive that would pair with the product, coincidentally my mom, who lives in Malaysia, called for our scheduled weekly catching up conversations. We were having a conversation with; about the type of ingredients I need to buy as well as the steps for her curry chicken dish that I wanted to replicate. While I was writing down the steps, she shares her sentiment of how she wished there is a place where she could write down her recipes so she could share it to me; thus both of us would have access to the recipe. Initially, I pitched her the idea of starting a food blog, but it soon dawned me that it was not a viable idea. My mom might be able to navigate and use Facebook, but to start a blog is way out of her technological reach.

It was then it unfolded, design a platform centered around sharing food recipes from around the world while making the grocery budgeting tool the supplementary tool. The data we collected pointed us in this direction from the start; people didn‚Äôt want a primary budgeting tool; they needed a trigger that is not financials to push them to utilize the budgeting tool.

# How Might We
After the team validated and scoped our problem statement we started to brainstorm our how might we (HMW) statement. How might we design a medium around food to build a global community while also solving the localized grocery budgeting problem.

# User Personas
Our projected target users for the platform as guided by our research and HMW statement are users who desire a platform to share their culture through food, share their recipes, a tool to budget their groceries and monitor their spending. The team eventually narrowed down to two primary potential users that would utilize our platform for the two primary functions. We named our user personas ‚ÄòFelix‚Äô and ‚ÄòAunt Pauline.‚Äô Felix is a junior at UW who has grocery budgeting problems, desire to try new food from around the world, while Aunt Pauline is a stay-at-home mom from Singapore who wants a medium to share her recipes and to an extent her culture.

## Persona Segmentation
After identifying two primary subset of potential target users, the team moved on to segmentate the two groups into smaller subsets within their own category. Felix belongs to the category in which grocery budgeting is the primary goal whereas Aunt Pauline belongs to the category in which the ability to share recipes is the primary goal.

#### Group 1:

| The Professional (Jonathan)| The Impressionist (Margot)| The Collegiate (Felix) |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Slightly richer in food knowledge, minimal amount of time  | Minimal food knowledge, excess amount of time | Minimal food knowledge, minimal amount of time |

#### Group 2:

| The Masterchef (Gordon)| The Culturist (Andrew) | The Family (Aunt Pauline)|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Rich in food culture, minimal amount of time, minimal technology knowledge | Minimal food culture, excess amount of time, rich in technology knowledge | Rich in food culture, excess amount of time, minimal technology knowledge |

Despite two groups having different end-user goals, they all have a common pain point which ties them together. The common pain point that they face is that all of these user personas are financially limited.

## User Journey Map
The user journey map is our product road map. The team utilized the journey map to visualize the positive and negative points while interacting with our platform, environmental factors and the overall experience of reaching the end-goal of the user. In this user journey map, we follow the journey of Jonathan, he is a father of two and a full-time construction supervisor in Seattle. As noted earlier, all of our user personas have a common pain point which is somewhat financially restricted. At the start of the journey, we see Jonathan began with an inquiry into a problem that is exclusive to him, which then led him to seek out a solution that meant engaging with our platform. After engaging our platform, he chooses our platform as an intervention for his problem. The key thing to note here in this section is that Jonathan is yet to be sure that our platform would result in a positive outcome, thus we see a spectrum of his emotions of his uncertainty. After utilizing our product, Jonathan is pleasant with the platform and has successfully help him achieve his end-user goal. However, he wished the platform had more to offer.

# Solution
Chowtime, a cross-platform application that allows people everywhere to share and experience different, unique cultures through the medium of food. Chowtime will also feature an in-application tool that helps the user with grocery budgeting to prevent overspending.

## Product Storyboarding
Before diving straight into designing and prototyping the product, the team wanted to visualize the experience, thus we storyboarded the product experience with our user research participants. The team wanted insights on how our target users envision the experience on using our product versus how we, the creators, envision the experience. During the workshop, the team observed and looked for intersectionalities between our own storyboards and the participants. This exercise helped guide us in designing the features that our users actually need for the final product hence saving on time and resources.

## Technology Stack
Our team considered the technology stack of the product very carefully while we were collaboratively designing the product. We wanted to ensure that we designed a product that is possible to be developed, engineered, and easily maintained. Since the product is designed to be cross-platformed, building the application on a MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS) stack would be the most optimal path because the React framework has cross-development functionality of the web, iOS, and Android. As for our grocery comparison querying API, we have decided to build with Basketful. Building proprietary software requires a hefty amount of budget, hence Basketful provides us an easy hack to the problem as they handle the grocery data and the nitty gritty algorithm. Basketful also charges based on the number of serves, which would help us improve our financials while the product is experiencing downtime.

## Low-fidelity Prototype
During the time while the team was ideating the application on sketches, we were introduced the method of collaborative sketching from our advisor, Professor Emma Rose in week 7 of the user-centered design class. The team tried the method and we absolutely loved it so we moved on to implement the method from there on out. The team loved that we were able to iterate our designs as a cohesive team and by using the collaborative sketching methodology, we sped up our production rate by almost 10x while doing it individually.

## Wireframes
After sketching our low-fidelity prototype, identifying the design constraints, and consulting with our advisor, we moved on to developing wireframes for the product as we move closer to prototyping the high-fidelity version of the product.

![Wireframes-1](/images/stock-13.png)

![Wireframes-2](/images/stock-14.png)

While half of the team was wireframing the interface of the product, the other half worked on selecting typography, design languages for iconography, and color templates for our application. The team also consulted the Accessibility chapter of Google‚Äôs Material Design documentation to ensure our designs adhere to W3C‚Äôs accessibility standards and is inclusive to a wide range of users.

## High-fidelity prototype
The team designed the iconography, the logo, editing of stock images using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. Stock images were sourced from Unsplash and the color template reference index was sourced from Adobe Color. The product uses the Roboto typography throughout the application. The fonts were sourced from Adobe Fonts. The team used Sketch, Adobe XD, and Figma to prototype the product, adding functionality to core features, providing the illusion of an actual working product for usability testing later down the road. Finally, we used Rotato to get 3D animation shots of the prototype and post-produced everything in Adobe Premier Pro. [Watch the product video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeJFiFDooGM).

## Product features
The team set out to design Chowtime to address the problem defined at the very start directly. We wanted to design a brand-new platform without breaking the wheel. Thus, we designed a platform that is different but familiar, engaging, but not intimidating. Listed below are the core-features of Chowtime:

* A text box that allows users to write and post their recipes. We understand the nuances of textual formatting; thus, we implemented machine learning natural language processing (NLP) models to assist in automatically rendering the plain text into beautiful recipe formatting. The goal is to ensure that our users could focus on writing rather than thinking about formatting errors.

* A recipe page that focuses on the things that matter, such as the calories of the meal, servings, level of difficulty, dietary restrictions, and much more. We also took a step forward by embedding imperial versus metric converters right into the application itself. We understand that the global audience uses a myriad of different measurement standards, hence our inclusivity. The recipe page also includes videos, images, and textual instructions which font sizes are adjustable. Our team understands that there are visually impaired users, which is why we implemented the font size changing feature.

* Dynamic grocery shopping list. With one button, users can add all the required ingredients for their dishes into their shopping list. Chowtime‚Äôs shopping list not only allows you to add more miscellaneous items. The shopping list includes a dynamic price comparison tool that is powered by Basketful. Now our users can compare prices among multiple stores without ever going to the store. Our tool will save many shoppers time and money. For shoppers that do not have time to head to the store, we partnered with Instacart to enable grocery delivery right to your doorstep.

* Chowtime includes in-app map navigation. After our users decide which store to head to, they could navigate directly to the store using our built-in mapping system powered by Google Maps. On the mobile app, the shopping list is directly integrated into the map to ensure the ease of navigating our application while our users are shopping.

# Usability Testing
After launching our prototype, the next step we need was to gain metrics as soon as possible in order to improve the performance of the platform. Each member of the team was delegated to conduct usability test using one or more of the methods listed below.

## Methods
The team utilized usability testing methods such as First Click Testing (FCT), System Usability Scale (SUS), AB testing, contextual interviews, user scenarios, and user task analysis.

![Usability Test](/images/stock-15.png)

## Findings and sorting
Chowtime gained a massive amount of feedback, ranging from the next revolutionary product to I don‚Äôt see myself using this product. Usability tests can sometimes be absolutely gut retching due to negative critique on a product that we spend copious amount of time working on. In order to improve the product, we needed to listen to our users but needed to be objective about the feature requests.

Our team used the card sorting method to help sort through the dense amount of product feedback. Our team then ranked the features by importance and requirement as well as the difficulty to implement a specific feature. Our team soon narrowed down to three main features.

* More controls, more filters, more dietary restriction options.

* Ability to change the color to grayscale to reduce blue light, this would help improve the recipe reading experience.

* Reduce jargon on privacy policy and be more transparent about the maintenance of user data.

# Future Implementations
After implementing the revision on the product, the team plans to run another comprehensive usability test to gain even more insights and metrics in regards to the interaction between our product and our users. While we are conducting our study, the team also plans to work on the accessibility features of Chowtime such as dark mode, voice-only mode, and many more. The team also plans to reach out to engineers to help re-design and engineer the information architecture as well as the tangibility of building Chowtime.

# Reflection
As the team leader, I set the curiosity culture and the expectations of the team in terms of deliverables during the inception of the project, on day one. I ensured each member of my team has a voice and that we operate as a democracy. I understood that everyone has obligations outside of the classroom; hence, whenever we had a member who was not able to attend class, we will always help them catch up to speed. For communication tools, we used Slack to communicate with each other. We also set up a shared Google Drive to share files as well as a shared Google Calendar to keep track of tasks and deadlines.

The team worked well because of the work ethic displayed by each member. Everyone wanted to succeed because we had a vision for our product we truly cared about. I also believe that because we set the tone and the culture of the team at the very start, everyone knows what the expectations for the team are. Furthermore, we encourage individuals to be vocal and ask questions. This definitely helped as members feel like they wouldn‚Äôt be scrutinized against just because they asked a question.

In terms of what I would do differently in the future, and if more time were available, I would have organized team outings to build a stronger relationship between all the members. Doing something casual and different for a change would most certainly breath new life and bring a different perspective to everyone. This team has thought me that being a leader is so much more than just delegating tasks to members. Being a leader means being considerate, having the ability to listen as well as empathize, and sharing the burden of the project with the team.
